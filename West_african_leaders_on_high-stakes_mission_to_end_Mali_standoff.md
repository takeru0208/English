Ghana ivory coast and niger their presidents on an extraordinary mission in Bamako aimed at ending Mali's political crisis.

"We are here to meet president Keita and the various party concerned to bring peace and ensure that Mali returns on the path of stability for the sake of the whole region."

Outside their meeting, demonstrators supporting the Malian opposition leader Sumaila site. He remains missing after being abducted during parliamentary elections in April.

"IT is time for these African heads of state to intervene in the actions of Ibaka and his government to bring Sumaila Aziza back to his family safe and sound as soon as possible."

In his absence, an unprecedented protest movement calling itself the m5 among its leader Iman Mahmudico but also leaders of the opposition in civil society. All are calling for president Ibrahim Bubakar Keta to resign. Police fired bullets in July as demonstrators attempted to set fire to the national assembly, build roadblocks and seize control of the national TV station.

The west African regional organization ecowas made a series of recommendations on Sunday to end the crisis, including setting up a new constitutional court to rule over 31 contested parliamentary seats and creating a national unity government. But the M5 rejected the recommendations and demands the resignation of president Keta.

They are blaming the crisis in Mali to the issue of the second round of the legislative elections. I think this is a fundamental mistake. The main issue is that Ibrahim Bubakarkaida when he came to power in 2013, had specific pledges which are ending the war in the north.

Millions of Millions fled years of fighting between Mali's army and armed groups linked to Al-Qaeda and Isil in the north and center of the country attacks in Mali and neighboring countries continue despite 14,000 french and U.N troops based in the Sahel.

Seven years after becoming president, Keita's critics say he's failed to deliver peace and is unable to unite Malians seeking a better future.
